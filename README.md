# PDF Password

PDF Password allows to password-protect PDF documents.


## Usage

Drag and drop a PDF file unto the PDF Password window. 
In case the PDF is already password protected, you can unlock it by providing the correct password.

You can then specify a password and save a password-protected, encrypted copy of the PDF.
Leaving the password field empty will save a copy without password protection and without encryption.
